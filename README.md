# Try out Django Channels today! 

This is an example app demonstrating how to use (and deploy) [Django Channels](http://channels.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). It's a simple real-time chat app â€” like a very, very light-weight Slack. There are a bunch of rooms, and everyone in the same room can chat, in real-time, with each other (using WebSockets).


## To deploy to Heroku:

First, press the Heroku button to deploy the app:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/jacobian/channels-example)

Once the app finishes deploying, press *Manage App*, and turn on the worker dyno:

Then you're ready to go! Come back to our booth, show us your app, and we'll give you a brand new pair of limited-edition Heroku socks.
